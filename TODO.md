- easily integrates with already existing dotfile repos - no overhead
- non-opinionated
- intended to use with cron
- toml config file
- ? cli flags
  - destination path
  - source files/folders
- templates
  - for different users/system files
  - stored in different folders
- integrates well with vcs
  - keeps license, readme, changelog, todo type files
- compares files/folders to determine if a change is needed
- option to keep/delete files/folders that have been deleted since last backup
  - user decides through an option
  - example scenario
    - user backs-up folder `~/.config/nvim`
    - old backup had `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/lsp.lua`
    - deleted between backups
    - new backup should decide whether to delete the old file or keep it.
- deploy configuration to system
- keeps multiple timed backups (weekly, daily, monthly)
  - integrates with cron
- named backups
- set-and-forget entries
  - once backed-up, no further backups are made
  - ex. discord config file, gtk config files - files change often, are filled with unwanted junk, but we only want the config file to remain that way
